# oneAPI for Fedora Linux
This repository hosts a collection of [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
RPM SPEC Sheets for the
[Intel oneAPI Platform](https://oneapi.io).
These SPEC Sheets implement a great portion of the stack, ranging from low-level
interfaces, over compilers to high-level application libraries.

## Installation
Coming soon


## Contributing
Your contribution is always welcome. Before making a pull request, please open
an issue at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CosmicFusion/oneAPI-COPR/issues)
to report the problem with build/error logs.

and add it to your commit.
As we want to building oneAPI in chroots in build systems we would greatly appreciate if you test that the package builds in a clean chroot such as mock.

## Thanks again [rocm-arch](https://github.com/rocm-arch/rocm-arch)
for putting your README.md file out there so i can steal it once again .
